## Howdy Spring Boot

A simple Spring Boot example that has a Random Name generator.

Full random name:  
``/names``

Random first name:  
``/names/first``

Random last name:  
``/names/last``

Howdy Boot, Howdy Kotlin, Howdy Nodejs and Howdy Python are all simple microservices that each expose a different random API implemented in a different language.  For example, Howdy Boot exposes a random name API, Howdy Kotlin exposes a random address API, Howdy Nodejs exposes enpoints to encrypt and decrypt text and Howdy Python exposes a random number API.  All examples that show the power of PCF to run microservices in a language-agnostic manner ( awe yeah).
